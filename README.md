# 05_predict_traffic_congestion
This project aims to predict traffic congestion levels—classified as High, Medium, or Low—using traffic sensor data. By analyzing key features such as traffic volume, average speed, weather conditions, and road types, a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) is trained to identify congestion patterns.
